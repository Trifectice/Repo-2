# <SEO site source optimization>

## Description

I was given a project to optimize the source code of this web page. I Broke down all different challenges andwrote them as issues on my repo and tackled them individually. 

* First was cleaning up the semantics of the HTML and adjusting the CSS style sheet to fit the new changes. 
* Second was removing redundant lines from the Style sheet. 
* Third was adding proper notes to the Style sheet to explain the purpose of each group of code.
* Lastly was getting the new web page deployed using git hub pages. 

This project taught me how to go and get the information I needed to best tackle the listed issues above, such as how to properly add semantics to an inde.html file and format a style sheet.

## Changes 
Bellow are some images of the issues I saw and corrected for this challenge.
