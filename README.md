# <SEO Site Source Optimization>

## Description

This site was brought to me in need of some optimization to the HTML and Style sheet. There was not alt atributes, html semantics, and redudant css elements. Once reviewed and issues were broken down into sections of work I opened the issues on the github repo and tackled individually. N the semantics are orginized, css is cleaned up and with notes explaining each line of code, and bugs with tabs have been fixed. With this project I have been taught how to find information needed to tackle issues at hand.
